GUI project-Clothing Store
This project involves the development of a web-based clothing store application designed to provide an enhanced shopping experience for customers and order management for store owners. The web application will allow users to browse and purchase clothing items, with features for filtering by category, size, and color. The desktop application will support store managers with order processing, and sales reporting through a local database.
